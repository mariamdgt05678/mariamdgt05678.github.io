  <section class= <h1>About Me

  <p> I get so exicted in flying up in the sky in the plane so much especially wih my parent and simblings i feel like flying up in the sky is awesome and great I also get to go on the  plane on vacation time, which increases incrementally based on years of service. Pilots need, at minimum, a high school diploma, as well as a Federal Aviation Administration (FFA) commercial pilotâ€™s license and FFA certification as an Airline Transport Pilot.a pilot also get to meet different people,Being an airline pilot can lead to a lucrative paycheck. While the average median salary for airline and commercial pilots in 2017 was close to $112,000, the more experienced and versatile a pilot is, the higher the potential earnings. In addition to work as a commercial pilot, some pilots take on charters or private plane services, which can boost earnings even higher. Some pilots also find side jobs working as flight instructors.
